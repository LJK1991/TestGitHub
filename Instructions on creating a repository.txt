Intrusctions on creating a repository:

Create new directory on GitHub (with a description, private, initialize with README, add giftignore python, add a license)
Now I want to bring it to my local computer to be able to work in the terminal

In the terminal:
git clone https://github.com/LunavdL/TestGitHub.git

Now I cloned it (the directory can be found in the home folder), but I am not in the folder yet. So set working directory:
cd TestGibHub

To update the repository:
git pull

Now you can add documents, pictures etc.

For example: 
git echo “hello” > commands.txt
git echo “another sentence” >> commands.txt

Now you have created a file and you want to push this to the GItHub website:
git add –all :/ --> this adds everything to staged files
git status --> with this command you can see the status (changes are in green)
git commit -m “text about what I did” → telling this I what I did
git push → this pushes it to the website
(then you need to insert username and password)

If you want to switch to another repository, set new directory (cloning only needs to be done once) and then git pull to update.

You can also copy and paste documents in the graphical interfase on your local computer.
git pull will not show any changes, because you changed it on the local computer and git pull shows changes on the website.
